\chapter{Literature Survey}

In this chapter we present previous works that uses programming
language as a means to improve reliability of cryptographic applications.
In Section~\ref{sec:crypto_lang}, we give broad overview of several different
works, whereas in Section~\ref{sec:cryptol} we dig into the details of
the Cryptol programming language and the guarantees it provides.

\section{Languages for Cryptographic Applications}
\label{sec:crypto_lang}

The idea of using language features to enhance cryptogprahic applications 
have been investigated for over a decade. Some works, such 
as \cite{akinyele2013charm} builds upon existing languages, and provides
extensions, e.g. libraries and frameworks, for efficient implementation 
of cryptographic protocols. 
Other studies~\cite{lewis2003cryptol} create brand-new domain specific 
programming languages dedicated to cryptographic applications. These
works also focus on different aspects of implementation. Some focus
on relaibility and correctness guarantees, while others emphasize ease 
of use and performance.

Charm~\cite{akinyele2013charm} is an extensible framework in Python 
designed for rapid prototyping of cryptographic schemes. Charm promotes
modularity and reusability of cryptographic primitives, and successfully 
increases inter-operability of existing numeric libraries such Sage and
the Stanford Pairing-Based Crypto (PBC). It also provides benchmarking
and profiling utilities for determining the performance of cryptographic
algorithms.

NaCl~\cite{bernstein2012security} is a C/C++ library for implementing 
cryptographic protocols that 
provides security guarantee through features such as no data flow from 
secrets to load address, and no padding oracles. 

ZKPDL~\cite{meiklejohn2010zkpdl} is an interpreted description language 
for specifying zero-knowledge protocols, motivated by applications such
as electronic cash. Although the language is designed specifically for
implementing prover and verifer of zero-knowledge, the language itself 
also have potentials for specifying other types of privacy-preserving 
systems. The ZKPDL interpreter also performs optimizations for protocols.

EasyCrypt~\cite{barthe2014easycrypt} is an interactive framework for 
verifying the security 
of cryptographic applications. Building on EasyCrypt, 
The Ceritified computer-aided cryptography~\cite{almeida2013certified} 
project provides a computer-aided framework for proving concrete security for
 cryptogprahic implementations. It extends the EasyCrypt framework to
provide formal verification for cryptographic applications implemented 
in a C-like language. The framework also supports generation of 
optimized machine code based on the high-level language while
retaining the security properties.



\section{The Cryptol Language}
\label{sec:cryptol}

\newpage

\chapter{Implementation and Empirical Evaluation}

This section presents the implementation part of the project. 

\section{Design}

\section{High Assurance Programming with Cryptol}

% The plan has been realized successfully without hiccups.
% Followed the schedules. 

The aim of this project is to investigate domain specific languages
that enhance reliability of cryptographic algorithms. The focus of this
work is on Cryptol, however other languages with similar facilities will
also be covered as related works.

\caption{Time Line of The Project}
\label{fig:time}
\end{figure}


Therefore the first part of the project will be a brief survey of Cryptol
and similar languages. This part will also cover high-level design of
the Cryptol language and theory behind its functions for formal verification.

The second part of the project will be empirical study of the Cryptol language
with an implementation.
For the implementation part, the AES symmetric-key algorithm
\cite{standard2001announcing, bertoni2002efficient} is to be implemented
 and properties related to the algorithm will be defined and checked
in Cryptol to evaluate whether the language can efficiently verify
the implementation. AES is chosen because it is the modern standard
for symmetric-key encryption is widely used. 
The focus in this part is the evaluation of the language,
rather than actual implementation of the algorithm, therefore other
algorithms written in Cryptol, if available, will
also be used to conduct empirical evaluations.

Another tool provided as a part of the Cryptol project is called
The Software Analysis Workbench (SAW). SAW also provides formal verification
for properties of programs written in Cryptol.
SAW utilizes symbolic execution to translate programs into formal models.
This tool will also be used to verify the AES implementation in Cryptol
in order to see if it provides better functionalities for verification.

Figure~\ref{fig:time} provides a time frame for the project. This is just
a rough estimation, but the project will follow the steps specified.
As mentioned before, because the focus is investigation
of the Cryptol language, more time will be spent on evaluating the language
functionalities.
